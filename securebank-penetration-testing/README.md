## 🛡️ Overview
This project presents a structured vulnerability assessment and ethical penetration testing workflow for a simulated banking platform, **SecureBank**. The engagement covers threat identification, exposure analysis, penetration test planning, and secure data handling using encryption.

The assessment workflow aligns with industry practices for financial services security testing and demonstrates a full attack-to-remediation lifecycle.

## 🎯 Engagement Scope
- Identify a high-risk vulnerability using **IBM X-Force Exchange**
- Analyze public exposure using **Google Dorking**
- Design a penetration testing plan (scope, rules, exploitation, reporting)
- Secure sensitive credential data using **AES symmetric encryption**

## 🔎 Key Findings & Activities

### Vulnerability Intelligence
- Identified CVE-2024-43451 using IBM X-Force Exchange  
- Assessed exploitability and business impact  

### Exposure Analysis
- Used Google Dorking (site, filetype, gov operators) to simulate open-source reconnaissance

### Penetration Testing Plan
- Defined scope and objectives  
- Established rules of engagement  
- Designed discovery, exploitation, and reporting phases  

### Data Protection via AES Encryption
- Generated encryption keys  
- Encrypted sensitive credential files  
- Validated decryption and data integrity  

## 🧠 Security Value
This project demonstrates how threat intelligence, reconnaissance, testing strategy, and encryption controls can be combined to protect financial systems from real-world attack vectors.

It highlights the importance of structured testing, evidence-based reporting, and secure data handling in regulated environments.
