<hr/>

## 🧠 Overview
This project presents a full-scale **Incident Response (IR) and Digital Forensics framework** for a simulated organization, **SecureSync Corp**, aligned to the **NIST 800-61 Incident Response Framework**.

It demonstrates how security teams prepare for, detect, contain, eradicate, recover from, and analyze cybersecurity incidents while preserving digital evidence and maintaining regulatory readiness.

## 🎯 Engagement Scope
- Design a NIST-aligned Incident Response lifecycle  
- Define roles, escalation paths, and communication workflows  
- Establish monitoring and evidence-handling procedures  
- Outline a digital forensics workflow and reporting structure  

## 📂 Artifacts
- **SecureSyncCorp_IR_Forensics_Report.pdf** — full incident response & forensics framework  
- **/images/diagram_nist_lifecycle.png** — NIST IR lifecycle flow  
- **/images/diagram_roles_evidence.png** — roles & evidence handling flow  
- **references.txt** — research sources  

## 🔁 Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST)
- **Preparation** — tools, policies, roles, training  
- **Detection & Analysis** — monitoring, alert triage, classification  
- **Containment, Eradication & Recovery** — isolation, remediation, service restoration  
- **Post-Incident Activity** — lessons learned, reporting, control improvements  

## 🧪 Digital Forensics Workflow
- Evidence identification and collection  
- Chain of custody and integrity verification  
- Forensic analysis objectives  
- Reporting and legal readiness  

## 🧠 Security Value
This project demonstrates how structured incident response and forensic processes reduce downtime, limit damage, support compliance, and enable defensible investigations in regulated environments.
