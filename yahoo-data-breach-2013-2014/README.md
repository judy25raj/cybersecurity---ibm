## 🧩 Overview
This project analyzes the Yahoo data breaches of 2013 and 2014, which affected over 3.5 billion user accounts—the largest known data breach in history. The analysis explores root causes, response actions, business impact, and lessons learned, with recommendations for strengthening cybersecurity governance and breach readiness.

## 📊 Case Summary

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Type of Incident | Data Breach |
| Year(s) | 2013 & 2014 |
| Affected Accounts | 3B (2013), 500M (2014) |
| Data Exposed | Names, emails, phone numbers, birthdates, hashed passwords |
| Attack Vector | Phishing, cookie forgery |
| Disclosure Delay | Publicly revealed in 2016 |

## ⚙️ Root Causes
- Weak security controls and outdated encryption (MD5)
- Access to proprietary code enabling cookie forging
- Poor vulnerability management and monitoring

## 🔐 Actions Taken
- Implemented new security protocols and appointed a CISO
- Invalidated unencrypted security questions and answers
- Strengthened user security guidance and notifications

## 📈 Evaluation
- **Effectiveness:** Governance improved, but only after breach exposure  
- **Timeliness:** Response delayed by several years  

## 🧱 Business Impact
- **Financial:** $35M SEC fine and shareholder losses  
- **Reputational:** Severe trust erosion and brand damage  

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Adopt strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256) and MFA  
- Maintain proactive threat monitoring and disclosure timelines  
- Embed cybersecurity into organizational culture  

## 🧭 Recommendations
- Implement real-time breach detection systems  
- Upgrade encryption and password hashing standards  
- Establish rapid incident response playbooks  

## 🧩 Conclusion
The Yahoo breach demonstrates that cybersecurity resilience requires continuous vigilance, not reactive measures. Transparency, governance, and modern security controls are critical to protecting user trust and organizational integrity.
