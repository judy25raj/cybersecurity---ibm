## 🔒 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and validation of a secure enterprise network architecture using subnetting, traffic inspection, and firewall enforcement. The lab simulates a segmented corporate environment and applies layered security controls to restrict and monitor network traffic.

The implementation focuses on protecting internal systems from unauthorized access while allowing required services through controlled firewall rules.

## 🎯 Engagement Scope
- Design a segmented network with router, switch, and multiple subnets
