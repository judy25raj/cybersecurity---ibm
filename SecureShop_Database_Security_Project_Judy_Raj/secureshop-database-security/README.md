<hr/>

## 🧮 Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive **database security and data protection framework** for a simulated e-commerce platform, **SecureShop**, using MySQL.

The engagement applies encryption, data masking, role-based access control, and secure query practices to protect sensitive customer and payment data while ensuring operational integrity.

## 🎯 Engagement Scope
- Design and explore the SecureShop relational database  
- Implement encryption, decryption, and data masking controls  
- Configure role-based access control (RBAC) for users  
- Identify and mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities  

## 📂 Artifacts
- **/images/** — screenshots and validation evidence  
- **references.txt** — research sources  

## 🔐 Key Security Controls

### Data Protection
- Encrypted sensitive fields (phone numbers, payment data)  
- Masked personally identifiable information (postal codes)  

### Access Control
- Created restricted user roles (e.g., *Delivery Executive*)  
- Granted and revoked table-level permissions  

### Injection Mitigation
- Identified unsafe queries  
- Implemented parameterized queries to prevent exploitation  

## 🧠 Security Value
This project demonstrates how layered database security controls protect sensitive data, enforce least-privilege access, and reduce the risk of injection-based attacks in data-driven applications.
